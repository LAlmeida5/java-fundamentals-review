# Java Fundamentals Assessment Review
## 1. Fork this repository to your personal Github Account.
- Explore the structure of the `src` directory
- All your classes will live within the `java` directory 
## SEE BOTTOM OF README FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON TESTING YOUR CODE

## Problems


1. In the **main.AssessmentReview** class inside the `java` directory.

    - Write a public static method named `cubed` that accepts an integer as
      an argument and returns that integer to the third power.
    - Write a public static method named `difference` that accepts two arguments and
      that works with both integers and doubles (use method overloading). Both variations of the method 
      should return the result of subtracting the second argument from the first argument.
    - Write a public static method named `median` that receives an array of
      `int`s (please use an array, not a `Collection`) and returns the median as a `double`.
      - (Hint: there are examples of how to find median of an array in Java all over the internet)
      - (Hint: the sort method on the Arrays class may be very helpful here)
      - (Hint: make sure the median of `[1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7]` is `4.5`)



2. Create a class named **main.Pet** inside of `java`.

    - The class should define three fields. One of type `int` named
      `age`, one of type `boolean` named `isRescue`, and one of type `String` named `name`. These fields should not be accessible
      outside the **main.Pet** class.
    - Add a constructor method that has three parameters of the types above and sets `age`
      ,`isRescue`, and `name` properties based on the respective parameters.
    - If the passed `name` argument is `null`,
      the constructor should throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
    - Write getters and setters for all three fields.



3. Create a class named **main.Cat** inside of `java` that inherits from **main.Pet**.

    - Add a private field named `color` that is a String. This
      field represents the color of each instance of **main.Cat**.
    - Write the constructor on **main.Cat** that has 4 parameters: the age
      of the cat, a boolean indicating whether the cat is a rescue, what the cat's name is, and the color of the cat. The corresponding fields of the object
      should be set based on the arguments passed to the constructor.
     (Hint: use of the super constructor may be useful here)
    - Write a getter and setter on the **main.Cat** class for the `color` field.



4. Create a class named **main.Dog** inside of `java` that also inherits from **main.Pet**.

   - Add a private field named `breed` that is a String. This
     field represents the breed of each instance of **main.Dog**.
   - Write the constructor on **main.Dog** that has 4 parameters: the age
     of the dog, a boolean indicating whether the dog is a rescue, what the dog's name is, and the breed of the dog. The corresponding fields of the object
     should be set based on the arguments passed to the constructor.
     (Hint: use of the super constructor may be useful here)
   - Write a getter and setter on the **main.Dog** class for the `breed` property.



5. Create an interface named **main.Meowable** inside of `java`.

    - The **main.Meowable** interface should specify a public abstract method named `meow`
      that accepts no arguments and returns nothing.
    - Change your **main.Cat** class so that it implements the **main.Meowable** interface.
    - The implementation of the `meow` method on main.Cat class should print the following message:
      ```
      This is a meow!
      ```



6. Create an interface named **main.Barkable** inside of `java`.

   - The **main.Barkable** interface should specify a public abstract method named `bark`
     that accepts no arguments and returns nothing.
   - Change your **main.Dog** class so that it implements the **main.Barkable** interface.
   - The implementation of the `bark` method on the **main.Dog** class should print the following message:
     ```
     Bork bork!
     ```
 

   
7. On your **main.AssessmentReview** class create a static method named `uppercaseCatColor`.

   This method should:

    - Receive an `ArrayList` of **main.Cat** objects as a parameter.
    - The method should return an `ArrayList` of **main.Cat** objects, where each **main.Cat**
      object's `color` field is in uppercase.

   Sample Input

     ```
     a main.Cat object with a color of "black"
     a main.Cat object with a color of "orange"
     a main.Cat object with a color of "white"    
     ```
   Sample Output

    ```
    a main.Cat object with a color of "BLACK"
    a main.Cat object with a color of "ORANGE"
    a main.Cat object with a color of "WHITE"  
    ```

   Hints

    - Check to make sure that each **main.Cat**'s `color` field is already uppercase
    - If the `color` field is not already uppercase, **_USE THE SETTER_** to change the `color` field to uppercase.
    

## Testing your Code

You can (and are encouraged to) use the classes in the **test-methods** package to test the code that you have written.
You will need to uncomment the code in the main method of each class and run it. Make sure the output matches the example output in comments.
**DO NOT UNCOMMENT THE OUTPUT PORTION**
